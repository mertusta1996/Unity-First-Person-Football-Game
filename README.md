This project is the creation of a "first person football game mechanism" in Unity 3D game engine by a software developer named Mert Usta.

There are some demo gifs for my project :

-  Scroll Mouse Click for getting new ball.


## What were the subjects focused on?

- Creating a game mechanism clearly playable.
- Using Unity's "Animation Blend Tree" system (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BlendTree.html) for making responsive character control animations.

- Finding and using free 3D models, free textures, free sound effects for any usage. (Sources : sketchfab.com, textures.com, creazilla.com, pixabay.com, flaticon.com)
- Thinking and understanding how a game module could work, then I designed and coded this game module with my own ways.
